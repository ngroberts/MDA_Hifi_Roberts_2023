### Analyses done for the manuscript.

Analyses done for the manuscript. Please reach out to me at:

> ngroberts@crimson.ua.edu

If you are trying to recreate an anlysis or a visualization (e.g. circos) and having issues please reach out to me.

### Contents:

> R_project

R project for the manuscript. This contains old, deprecated, and new analyses done in R. 

> annotation

The commands used for braker, and the braker log.

> calculating_repeats_and_coverage 

A semi-tutorial about how to create 100kb blocks, attach GC content, coverage, and repeat content. This is useful for data anlysis, but also used as input for the circos plots.

>repeat_coverage_C_elegans
>repeat_coverage_L_squamata

Files needed for the above analysis on repeat content and GC content. 

>circos_plot_*
>
>dna_diff

Code for the circos plots, feel free to use this as a template but my file paths are retained.

>seqkit

How the pseudo short reads were made using seqkit, mapped, and removed.
